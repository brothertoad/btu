# btu
Some utilities functions for go programs. "btu" stands for "brothertoad utilities".  I chose
not to use the name utils, since there are probably already a few modules out there named
utils. :grin:

As a relative newcomer to the gopher world, I found myself adding a few functions to each of my projects.
I decided to put them in one module so I could reuse them.  Note that my projects are usually command line
applications, and simply log a message and exit if something goes wrong.
